If you forget your password, you can use the <span className="text-orange-700">Reset Password</span> link to reset it.

The implementation of the email and password sign-in method is based on the `NextAuth` service with prisma adapter. The service provides a secure and efficient way to manage user authentication and authorization.

  signing in with a provider{" "}
